    title: "One Punch man",
    description: `On an unnamed Earth-like super-continent planet, powerful monsters and villains have been wreaking havoc in the cities. To combat them, the world's government created a Hero Association that employs superheroes to stop them. The heroes are ranked from Class C to Class S. Saitama, an unassociated hero, hails from the metropolis of City-Z and performs heroic deeds for his own entertainment. He has trained himself to the point where he broke his "limit" and can effortlessly defeat any opponent with a single punch while slaying monsters the same way. But he is now bored with his own omnipotence and frustrated from his lack of sensing challenge. Over the course of the series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, friends, villains, and monsters. He becomes a reluctant mentor to cyborg Genos, who moves in with him and is seeking revenge against another cyborg that slaughtered his entire family and hometown. Eventually, the two join the Hero Association in order to gain recognition. Genos proves to be a prodigy and is instantly placed in Class S, while Saitama barely passes the written portion of the Hero test and is placed in Class C. Saitama performs many feats that go mostly unnoticed and unappreciated by the public because of his rank, but he is promoted to Class B after defeating the powerful Deep Sea King, who rains destruction on City-J. Rumors surface that strong monsters are gathering in City-Z. Soon after, the great seer Shibabawa has a vision that the world is in danger before she dies. Panicking, the Hero Association calls all S-Class heroes to a meeting, begging them to protect the world. Immediately after the meeting, the leader of the Dark Matter Thieves Boros invades the planet and destroys City-A. The S-Class heroes fight the invaders outside the ship, while Saitama finds their leader and defeats him. The S-Class Hero Metal Knight quickly repairs the damage done to City-A in the aftermath. Saitama begins to gradually meet other superheroes, such as the martial artist Bang and King, the "Strongest Man on Earth", who is actually a fraud unassumingly taking credit for Saitama's deeds. Growing aware of monsters' increasing rate of appearance, the Hero Association tries to recruit more heroes and even begins recruiting villains. When the Hero Association executive Sitch tries to do so, Bang's former apprentice Garou begins beating heroes left and right to break their morale. Garou's ruthlessness earns him the title "hero-hunter" and the threat level "Dragon", the second most dangerous threat level. In order to support himself financially, Saitama enters a martial arts tournament in disguise as Charanko, a disciple of Bang. During the tournament, the Monster Association attacks various cities and kidnaps the child of one of the Hero Association's executives. The Monster Association offers "monster cells" to various groups of people, which will turn people into monsters when eaten, while the Hero Association stages a rescue for the kidnapped child.`,

    title: "One Piece",
    description: `Gol D. Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous pirate to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies one's standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffyâ€™s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Shanks, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece!`,

    title: "Death Note",
    description: `In Tokyo, an intelligent yet disaffected high-school student named Light Yagami finds the "Death Note", a mysterious black notebook which can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. After verifying that the notebook works and initially being terrified of its god-like abilities, Light begins to consider the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and sets out to create a utopian world without crime, killing numerous high-profile Japanese criminals, before eventually targeting international criminals and felons around the world. Eventually, Light is visited by Ryuk, a "Shinigami," beings inspired by the Japanese god of death and the Death Note's previous owner, who dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom. Ryuk, who is invisible to anyone who has not touched the Death Note, is amused by Light's actions and serves as Light's companion. As numerous criminals and convicts around the world begin to die of inexplicable freak accidents and heart attacks, the global media begin to believe that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him "Kira", the Japanese transliteration of the word: "killer", who is both feared and beloved by the public and law enforcement agencies. Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic and highly esteemed international consulting detective, known as L, who has cracked numerous crime cases around the world, to assist them in the investigation. After deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L stages a TV broadcast in which he tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan, by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Humiliated, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L quickly deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police's investigation, led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that "Kira" could have familial connections with the members of the "Kira" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation, but Light outmaneuvers and kills them all. Nonetheless, L picks up enough hints to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, both trying to get the other to reveal crucial info. At this point, a famous model/actress named Misa Amane gains a second Death Note from a Shinigami named Rem. Misa makes a deal with Rem for Shinigami eyes, which allows her to kill knowing only the face at the cost of half her lifespan. Misa commits numerous murders, sends taped recordings to the police, and eventually uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira. Infatuated with Light, she demands Light be her boyfriend. Although he does not love Misa, Light agrees, intending to use Misa's Shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. However, before she can do so, L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem, who has feelings for Misa, threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. Now with no knowledge of the Death Note, Light wholeheartedly joins the investigation. Together, Light and L deduce Higuchi's identity, arrest him, and discover the existence of the Death Notes and the Shinigami. When they touch the Death Note, Light and Misa regain their memories, and Light kills Higuchi with a piece of the Death Note, regaining possession of the book. However, L casts suspicion on Misa, forcing Rem to murder L to save her. Rem dies in the process, as it is forbidden for Shinigami to prevent humans from dying. The task force agrees to cover up L's death and appoint Light as the new L. The investigation stalls as a result.  Four years later, crime rates worldwide have massively dropped, but cults have arisen which adore Kira. Two intelligent young men, who were raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Both are aware that L is dead, and thus consider Light, the current L, a prime suspect. Mello, along with the Mafia's assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during the rescue mission. As suspicion starts to fall again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints a well-known newscaster, Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello with a hidden page of the Death Note but is killed by Light in order to dispel suspicions. Shortly after, Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light seizes the chance to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members. However, Mikami's Death Note fails to work. It is revealed that Near had replaced Mikami's Death Note with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. A scuffle breaks out during which Light is grievously wounded. Ryuk, realizing that Light will spend the rest of his life in prison, writes down Light's name in his Death Noteâ€”as he had promised to do at the beginning of the story.`,
